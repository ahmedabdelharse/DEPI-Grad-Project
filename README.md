- Integrate Ansible for consistent and reliable application deployments across infrastructure
- Containerize applications using Docker for easy portability and scalability
- Leverage GitHub Webhooks for automated triggering of the CI/CD pipeline upon code commits
- Utilize AWS cloud computing benefits, such as scalability and availability, to handle projects of any size
  
## What You'll Learn
- How to create an efficient and flexible CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Ansible, and Docker
- How to integrate GitHub Webhooks for seamless integration of application changes
- How to take advantage of cloud computing benefits on AWS
- How to improve development workflow, empower collaboration, and boost project efficiency
